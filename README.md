# Data Scientist Case Study: Direct Marketing Optimisation

This repository contains a case study for direct marketing optimisation.

In financial industry, institutions frequently use direct marketing campaigns to promote their products, for example, consumer loans, credit cards, and mutual funds. However, such campaigns are constrained by operational limitations, such as the number of clients that can be contacted and the capacity to tailor offers to individual needs. Effective targeting strategy ensures that the right clients receive the most relevant product offers, resulting in higher conversion rates, improved client satisfaction, and increased revenue.

In this particular use case, the key objective is to
* Predict the clientâ€™s likelihood of purchase for a consumer loan, credit card, and mutual fund, respectively.
* Optimise targeting strategy and allocation of marketing offers to maximise revenue.
